Abstract: Bighead carp inhabits various climates around the world and have multiple traits that contribute to its successful invasion, such as high fecundity, fast growth, and large body size. However, bighead carp also exhibits variable growth and maturation in different environments, which can affect these traits and, ultimately, impact population performance. In warmer climates, bighead carp experience faster subadult growth but mature at younger ages, resulting in smaller size at maturity, while populations at higher latitudes mature later in life at larger sizes.</description>
