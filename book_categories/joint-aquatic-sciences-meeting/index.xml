Abstract: Bighead Carp populations have established and caused great ecological and economic damage throughout the Mississippi River. Their range continues to expand and they currently threaten to invade the Laurentian Great Lakes, but it is uncertain how they will perform in new environments and under climate change. Around the world, Bighead Carp populations in different climates show variation in size-at-age and age of maturity. At higher latitudes, individuals grow more slowly and mature later in life at larger adult sizes, while those in warmer regions grow faster but mature younger and smaller.</description>
